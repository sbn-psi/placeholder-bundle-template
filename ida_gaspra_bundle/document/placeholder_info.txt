# gbo.ast.ida.gaspra Pre-Archive Bundle

## About

The gbo.ast.ida.gaspra Pre-Archive Bundle describes a package of data that has been made publicly available, but has not been fully archived into PDS.

This bundle is made available in order to make it possible for this data to have a DOI, and to make it discoverable in PDS4.

## Access instructions

Until the data is archived in PDS4, the data will be available at:

(https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/resource/idagaspra.html)

## Summary of the data

This package contains observations of the asteroids (243) Ida and (951)         
Gaspra extracted from the holdings of the Small Bodies Node, combined         
with observations by the Galileo mission magnetometer and solid state         
imaging system.

## Archiving Plan

The data will be ingested through the Small Bodies Node's ongoing migration projects. The migration is expected to be completed by DATE.

## Placeholder Lifecycle

Once the PDS4 migration is complete, this bundle will be replaced with a bundle containing the data.

The existing data pointed to above will not be deleted at that point.

## Placeholder Status

As of this publication, the data is not fully ingested into PDS. Once it is ingested, a new version of this bundle will be issued with the data.
