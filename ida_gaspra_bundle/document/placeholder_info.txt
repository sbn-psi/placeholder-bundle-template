# Gaspra Color Geometry Cubes Pre-Archive Bundle

## About

The Gaspra Color Geometry Cubes Pre-Archive Bundle describes a package of data that has been made publicly available, but has not been fully archived into PDS.

This bundle is made available to make it possible for the not-yet-archived data to be referenced by PDS LIDVID so it can be cited and discoverable.

## Access instructions

Until the data are archived in PDS, the data will be available at:

(https://sbn.psi.edu/review/asteroid16/gascolorgeom/)

## Summary of the data

This data set is a set of 6 ISIS image  
cube pairs describing the surface of Gaspra as imaged in 6 different  
filters along with the corresponding geometry angle (incidence,       
emission, and phase) values across the surface of the image. The first
cube contains the color observation (one filter or color per          
backplane) and the 3 geometry angles (one angle per backplane) at the 
resolution of the color data set. The second cube contains the 3      
geometry angles (one angle per backplane) at the full resolution of   
the shape file archived within the PDS.

## Archiving Plan

The data will be ingested into the Small Bodies Node. The process is expected to be completed by DATE.

## Placeholder Lifecycle

Once the archiving is complete, this bundle will be replaced with a bundle containing the data.

The existing data pointed to above will not be deleted at that point.

## Placeholder Status

As of this publication, the data is not fully ingested into PDS. Once it is ingested, a new version of this bundle will be issued with the data.
