December 1999.                                                                
                                                                              
                                                                              
This CDROM contains observations of the asteroids (243) Ida and (951)         
Gaspra extracted from the holdings of the Small Bodies Node, combined         
with observations by the Galileo mission magnetometer and solid state         
imaging system.                                                               
                                                                              
Distinct DATA_SET_ID values have been assigned to these files to              
differentiate them from the full data sets from which they were               
extracted. A DATA_SET_COLLECTION description has been provided to             
easily identify this collection in the PDS central catalog.                   
                                                                              
Existing PDS catalog files (for the Galileo mission and instruments           
and the SBN asteroid catalogs) are duplicated here for the convenient         
reference of the user. Some additional documentation and indexing are         
also provided.                                                                
                                                                              
[NOTE: The TARGET catalog files for targets (other than Ida and Gaspra)       
       mentioned in the Galileo mission description are NOT included          
       here. These are available from the PDS Central Node.]                  
                                                                              
The collection was reviewed in October 1995 and has since been residing       
in the on-line archives of the Small Bodies Node, available to users.         
This disk is being created now to formally ingest the collection into         
the PDS archives.                                                             
                                                                              
Note that the original collection included preliminary listings for           
the Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) Experiment              
Data Record (EDR) files. However, interpretation of these files is            
a complex affair - so much so that they are not being included in             
this collection. Users interested in the NIMS data should inquire             
directly of that science team. As of this writing, the NIMS team              
maintained a Web site at this URL:

Subsequent format editing and preparation of additional documentation         
required for final archiving were performed by personnel of the               
Small Bodies Node at the University of Maryland.
