# gbo.ast.loneos.survey Pre-Archive Bundle

## About

The gbo.ast.loneos.survey Pre-Archive Bundle describes a package of data that has been made publicly available, but has not been fully archived into PDS.

This bundle is made available to make it possible for the not-yet-archived data to be referenced by PDS LIDVID so it can be cited and discoverable.

## Access instructions

Until the data are archived in PDS, the data will be available at:

(https://sbnarchive.psi.edu/loneos/)

## Summary of the data

The full SBN LONEOS data holdings are now being made available to the public 
domain as of Sept. 15, 2020 in their unrestored and unarchived form.  There
are no restrictions on the use of these data.  The data have no original
documentation, non-standard FITS filenames, at least seven different
versions of FITS headers among the image files, and numerous duplications. 
These and other deficiencies would have to be ameliorated before the data
set could be archivable in PDS.

## Archiving Plan

The LONEOS data is expected to be archived by DATE.

## Placeholder Lifecycle

Once the PDS archiving is complete, this bundle will be replaced with a bundle containing the data.

The existing data pointed to above will be replaced with the archived data and will no longer be available.

## Placeholder Status

As of this publication, the data is not fully ingested into PDS. Once it is ingested, a new version of this bundle will be issued with the data.
