  This dataset includes the Galileo Orbiter Solid State Imaging               
  data on the asteroid 951 Gaspra in ISIS cube format, where for each color   
  set obtained the images have been spatially co-registered with each other   
  and with images describing the incidence, emission, and phase angle values  
  across the surface. Each color backplane has been radiometrically           
  calibrated. The geometric angle backplanes are archived with the color data 
  at the spatial resolution of the color data, and then again separately at   
  the spatial resolution of the shape file. The shape file has already been   
  archived in the PDS with the data set name 'SMALL BODY SHAPE MODELS V1.0'.  
  'SMALL BODY SHAPE MODELS V1.0' and can be found by searching on the data set
  identification 'EAR-A-5-DDR-SHAPE-MODELS-V1.0'.                             
                                                                              
  The raw data have already been archived in PDS with the data set name

  The radiometrically calibrated images were co-registered using a combination
  of ISIS and IDL software. For all images it was assumed that the images     
  required a simple translation in coordinate system to co-register. The      
  registration was not performed in ISIS due to the unavailablitiy of camera  
  kernels (required by the ISIS software) within the PDS archive. All cubes   
  containing color data were centered on the image of Gaspra and cropped to a 
  150 x 150 sample and line dimension.                                        
                                                                              
  Geometry angle images were created using the AstroidApp-0913 software (a    
  java based program). Incidence, emission, and phase angle images were       
  created separately by AstroidApp-0913 and cubed together within IDL. These  
  full resolution cubes are archived as one of the cubes in each color set    
  image pair. The full resolution cube was reduced in resolution using IDL and
  co-register with the color images, forming the last 3 backplanes to the     
  color image cube (the second cube in the color set image pair).

  The data are included in a series of ISIS cube file pairs. The first cube   
  file of the pair is denoted with filenames of the form Set*_ColorGeom.cub,  
  where * denotes the color set identifier. The second cube file of the pair  
  is denoted with filenames of the form Set*_Geom.cub, where * denotes the    
  color set identifier.                                                       
                                                                              
  There are A-F color set identifiers. The general table, color-set_id.tab,   
  denotes which images were acquired at similar viewing conditions but in     
  separate filters, thus constituting a color image set. The table includes   
  image file named, filter name, and a designator for which color set the     
  image belongs. Images with the same designator value (A-F) belong to the    
  same color image set.

  The last 3 image backplanes are the geometry angles in the order of         
  incidence, emission, and then phase angles.                                 
                                                                              
  Cubes with the filenames in the form Set*_Geom.cub are 350x350x3 cubes,     
  where the order of the three backplanes are incidence, emission, and phase  
  angles. This cube corresponds to the last three backplanes of the

  This dataset includes only those Galileo SSI images in which 951 Gaspra     
  actually appears. No viable camera kernels for the time frame in which the  
  Gaspra images were acquired were included in the original PDS archive. These
  kernels are used by GLLSSICAL to convert raw values to reflectance. A work  
  around was used in which GLLSSICAL was set to assume nadir pointing for all 
  images. This produces negligible errors in radiometric values, but disables 
  any calculations of viewing and illumination conditions.
