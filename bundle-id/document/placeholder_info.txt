# BUNDLE_ID Pre-Archive Bundle

## About

The bundle_id Pre-Archive Bundle describes a package of data that has been made publicly available, but has not been fully archived into PDS.

This bundle is made available in order to make it possible for this data to have a DOI, and to make it discoverable in PDS4.

## Access instructions

(Put the URL for the data, along with any necessary credentials here. This will overlap with access_instructions.txt, but there may be value in having a separate file, so that it will be easy to find.)

## Archiving Plan

(Information about the steps needed to formally archive the data could go here)

## Placeholder Lifecycle

## Placeholder Status

As of this publication, the data is not fully ingested into PDS. Once it is ingested, a new version of this bundle will be issued with the data.
